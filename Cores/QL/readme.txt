This core needs a QL rom image on SD card named ql.rom in the SD cards root directory. 
It's known to work with Minerva ROM 1.98 as well as the original js.rom. 
Other ROMs may work as well. The ROM size must be exaclty 49152 bytes. 
Minerva and other roms are available as a free download from http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/qlrom/.
